# Command: `git commit`

## What Is This Command?  
`git commit` is a Git command used to save changes to your local repository.

## What Problem Does It Solve?  
When you're working on a project, you make changes over time.  
You need a way to **record those changes** so you can track your progress, go back if something breaks, or share updates with others.

## What Does It Do?  
`git commit` creates a **snapshot** of the current staged changes and adds it to your project's history.  
Each commit includes a custom message, so you and your collaborators know what was changed and why.
