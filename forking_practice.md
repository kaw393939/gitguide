### `git stash`

**What it does:**  
Temporarily saves (or "stashes") your uncommitted changes and reverts your working directory to match the latest commit. This lets you switch branches or work on something else without losing your current progress.

**Narrative:**  
You’re halfway through building a feature when your professor or team lead asks you to fix a bug on the main branch. Your changes aren’t ready to commit yet, so you use `git stash` to set them aside, switch to `main`, fix the bug, and come back later to finish what you were doing.
